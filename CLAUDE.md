# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains both a Python workout planner and a modern Next.js web frontend that generates personalized workout routines based on:
- Duration preferences (in minutes)
- Target muscle groups
- Time allocation per muscle group
- Exercise database stored in JSON format

## Commands

### Running the Python Application
```bash
python3 main.py
```
Runs the example workout generation with predefined parameters (30-minute workout targeting glutes, rear delts, and chest).

### Running the Next.js Frontend
```bash
cd workout-planner
npm install  # First time setup
npm run dev  # Development server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build  # Production build
```

### Testing the Applications
- **Python**: No formal test framework is configured. Testing should be done by running the main script and validating output manually.
- **Next.js**: The application includes TypeScript validation and ESLint checking. Run `npm run build` to validate the entire application.

## Code Architecture

### Python Components

**WorkoutPlanner Class (`main.py:6-172`)**
- Main application class that handles workout generation logic
- Loads exercise database from `exercises.json` on initialization
- Key methods:
  - `generate_workout()`: Main workflow that creates complete workout plans
  - `_select_exercises_for_group()`: Selects exercises for specific muscle groups within time constraints
  - `_calculate_summary()`: Computes workout statistics
  - `print_workout()`: Formatted output display

### Next.js Frontend Components

**Core Logic (`workout-planner/src/lib/`)**
- `workoutPlanner.ts`: TypeScript port of the Python WorkoutPlanner class with identical functionality
- `types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for Exercise, Workout, and related data structures
- `theme.ts`: Material-UI theme configuration for consistent styling

**UI Components (`workout-planner/src/components/`)**
- `WorkoutPlannerForm.tsx`: Interactive form with duration slider, muscle group selection, and time allocation controls
- `WorkoutDisplay.tsx`: Beautiful workout display with collapsible sections, exercise details, and summary statistics
- `ThemeProvider.tsx`: Material-UI theme wrapper component

**Main Application (`workout-planner/src/app/`)**
- `page.tsx`: Main application page that orchestrates form and display components
- `layout.tsx`: Root layout with Material-UI theme provider

**Exercise Data Structure (`exercises.json`)**
- Shared JSON database used by both Python and TypeScript implementations
- Contains exercise objects with:
  - `name`: Exercise name
  - `set_duration_sec`: Work period duration
  - `rest_duration_sec`: Rest period between sets
  - `tags`: Array of muscle groups and exercise categories
  - `notes`: Optional exercise notes
  - `link`: Optional video/reference links

### Workout Generation Logic

1. **Time Allocation**: Reserves 10 minutes for warmup (5 min cardio + 5 min stretching)
2. **Exercise Selection**: Uses tag-based filtering to match exercises to requested muscle groups
3. **Set Calculation**: Dynamically calculates number of sets (3-5) based on available time
4. **Organization**: Groups exercises by muscle group to prevent interleaving

### Key Features

**Both Python and TypeScript Implementations:**
- **Tag-based Exercise Filtering**: Exercises are categorized using hierarchical tags (e.g., "core family", "glutes", "rear delts")
- **Dynamic Time Management**: Automatically fits exercises within specified duration constraints
- **Structured Warmup**: Always includes standardized 10-minute warmup routine
- **Identical Logic**: TypeScript implementation produces the same workout results as Python version

**Additional Frontend Features:**
- **Material Design UI**: Clean, modern interface following Google's Material Design principles
- **Interactive Form Controls**: Duration sliders, multi-select muscle groups, dynamic time allocation
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on input errors and time allocation
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Beautiful Workout Display**: Collapsible sections, exercise details with video links, summary statistics
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators and error handling

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features
- **Frontend Interface**: Full Next.js Material-UI implementation completed
- **TypeScript Port**: Complete functional port of Python workout planner logic
- **Interactive UI**: Configurable duration, muscle groups, and time allocation
- **Exercise Display**: Beautiful workout presentation with all exercise details
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly Material Design interface

### TODOs and Development Plans

The original codebase includes several planned enhancements (`main.py:173-180`):
- Split exercises into multiple organized files
- ~~Add frontend interface for workout customization~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Implement hierarchical tag system
- Add exercise progressions and supersets
- Enhance exercise selection algorithms
- Support for specific exercise preferences

## Exercise Database Management

The shared `exercises.json` file contains a comprehensive exercise library with 35+ exercises organized by:
- **Core Family**: Core stability, rotator cuff, scapular stability (15+ exercises)
- **Glutes**: Hip thrusts, bridges, lateral movements (13+ exercises)  
- **General Exercises**: Push-ups, pull-ups, deadlifts
- **33 Unique Tags**: Including specific muscle groups like "rear delts", "glute medius", "rotator cuff"

Each exercise includes timing parameters and muscle group tags for automated selection during workout generation. The same database is used by both Python and TypeScript implementations to ensure consistency.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript and App Router
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for Material Design components
- **React 18** with modern hooks and state management
- **ESLint** and **TypeScript** for code quality

### Backend Logic
- **Python 3** for original implementation
- **TypeScript** for frontend logic (identical functionality)
- **JSON** for shared exercise database
